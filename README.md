# DSA210 Project– How Does My Academic Life Affect My Watching Habits?

## Project Proposal
In this project, I will be analyzing the relationship between my watching habits and my academic life. I will explore how academic workload changes several aspects of my watching habits such as the duration, genre, ratings, language of the movies I watch.

## Motivation 
As a cinephile I’ve realized my watching habits change when the semester begins. With the workload of the semester (exams, quizzes, assignments) I start to watch less movies or I watch something lighter. During semester I tend to avoid long or complex movies. With this project, I aim to explore this change not only in terms of the total time, but also what, how and when I watch. 

## Research Questions

Does my academic life really affect my watching habits?

How does the genre of what I watch change during semester?

Do I watch more Hollywood productions when semester begins?

Does my total watch time decrease when I have exams or deadlines?

Are the movies I watch during the semester lower-rated or less award-winning?

## Data and Collection  
I will examine duration, year, country, language, origin, ratings, date I watched for the movies. 

And for my academic life I plan to use the exam dates, homework dates and their frequency. I will enter these data manually into a CSV file to represent my academic workload level.

I regularly log the movies I watch on Letterboxd so for the movies I watch I will use my data from Letterboxd.

However, Letterboxd only gives me Date, Year, Rate, Name. To get the duration, genre, language,average ratings,cast of the movies I watch , I will use TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset which contains this information for movies. 

I created an academic workload file to get the dates of my exams,quizzes and homeworks.
